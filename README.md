# SafeVault Solution Overview

The SafeVault solution is a secure, modern web application designed with a Blazor WebAssembly frontend (`SafeVault.Frontend`), a robust ASP.NET Core backend (`SafeVault.Backend`), and a comprehensive testing suite (`SafeVault.Backend.Testing`). The frontend provides a responsive user interface for authentication and user management, while the backend handles business logic, data storage, and security. The testing project ensures the reliability and security of the application through automated tests. The solution adheres to OWASP Top 10 guidelines, focusing on secure password storage, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixes Applied

### 1. Saving Unencrypted Passwords in Database
- **Vulnerability**: Storing plaintext passwords in the database exposes sensitive user data in case of a breach.
- **Fix Applied**: The `AuthService` class hashes passwords using `BCrypt.Net.BCrypt` with a work factor of 12 before saving them. During authentication, passwords are securely verified using `BCrypt.Verify`.
- **Copilot's Assistance**: Copilot suggested the use of `BCrypt` for hashing and verification, ensuring compliance with OWASP guidelines for password storage.

### 2. SQL Injection
- **Vulnerability**: Directly embedding user inputs in database queries can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Fix Applied**: The project uses Entity Framework Core, which inherently applies parameterized queries, mitigating SQL injection risks. Additionally, the `AsNoTracking` method was added in `AuthService` to prevent unintentional data modifications during read operations.
- **Copilot's Assistance**: Copilot highlighted the use of `AsNoTracking` for read-only queries and reinforced the importance of parameterized queries in Entity Framework Core.

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Vulnerability**: Unsanitized user inputs could allow malicious scripts to execute in the browser, compromising user data.
- **Fix Applied**: The `AuthController` leverages the `ValidationHelpers` and `XssSanitizer` utilities to validate and sanitize user inputs. Inputs like `UsernameOrEmail` and `Password` are checked for invalid characters and potential XSS payloads before processing.
- **Copilot's Assistance**: Copilot suggested integrating input validation and sanitization methods, ensuring that user inputs are both safe and properly formatted.

## Conclusion

The SafeVault solution is a secure and reliable application that adheres to modern security standards. Copilot played a pivotal role in identifying vulnerabilities and suggesting fixes aligned with OWASP Top 10 guidelines. It provided secure coding practices, such as password hashing, input sanitization, and leveraging ORM features to prevent SQL injection. This collaboration ensured a robust and secure backend for the SafeVault application.
